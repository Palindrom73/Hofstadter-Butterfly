# Modified-Hofstadter-Butterfly
During my Bachelor thesis about C*-algebras and discrete groups, I used python to plot the spectrum of certain elements of the non-commutative torus respectively the group ring of the discrete Heisenberg group. The physical meaning behind this elements or operators can be found in the quantum Hall effect and as Markov operators for random walks on the discrete Heisenberg group.

Here you can find two implementations of the appering matrices where in the plots of the Hofstader butterfly I adapt an implementation of [manyu90](https://github.com/manyu90/Hofstadter-Butterfly). My own implementation in the code for the interpolation of the maximum norm resp. largest eigenvalue in absolute value of certain operators is rather mathematical.

P.S.: It can be assumed that the interpolation polynomial is indeed an upper bound of the maximum norm due to some numerical experiments. Still, there is also a proof of mine in which one part is unclear or not proven yet.
